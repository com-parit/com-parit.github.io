This section define the key terminologies and concepts associated with model comparison.

## What are software models?

<div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
Software models are abstract representations of a software system that help understand the design and behavior of different components in a software system. They serve as blueprints for the development of new systems and
as documentation for a project that could be used by newcomers to gain familiarity with the internal functioning of the system. 

Software models are generally categorized into Structural Models and
Behavioral Models; The former serve as representatives of the data model; showcasing classes, attributes, methods and their relationships while the latter capture the flow of information in the system and depict the interaction of components and sequence of events.

## What is (Domain) Model Comparison?

The comparison of software models is a fundamental task in MDE (Model
Driven Engineering) and MDRE (Model Driven Reverse Engineering) research, essential for various purposes such as software evolution, model-driven
development, model clone detection, and quality assurance.

There are two aspects of model comparison; syntactic and semantic. Syntactic comparison focuses on the structural similarity between models, disregarding semantic aspects, and plays a crucial role in identifying similarities
and differences between different versions of models or models created by
different stakeholders. Semantic comparison focuses on the resemblance
of two models with respect to their meaning or semantics. From the perspective of MDE, this could help identify model clones and aid with model
versioning. Additionally, semantic comparison of models could automate the
grading of software based assignments in academia; extracted models from
the studentâ€™s work could be compared with the benchmark models to check
the validity.
